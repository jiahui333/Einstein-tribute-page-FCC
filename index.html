   <h2> Einstein's major contributions </h2>
    <h3>Quantum Theory of Light </h3>
     <p class="contribution"> Einstein’s quantum theory of light proposed that light is composed of small packets of energy called photons that have wave-like properties. In this theory he also explained the emission of electrons from some metals they’re struck by lightning – this was called the photoelectric effect. </p>
     <h3> E=mc2 </h3>
      <p class="contribution"> This equation expresses the fact that mass and energy are the same physical entity and can be changed into each other. The link he demonstrated between mass and energy led to the nuclear energy today. </p>
     <h3> Brownian Movement </h3>
      <p class="contribution"> This could by far be the best Albert Einstein discoveries, where his observation of the zigzag movement particles in suspension, helped to prove the existence of atoms and molecules. </p>
     <h3> Special Theory of Relativity </h3>
      <p class="contribution"> This Einstein theory helped to explain that time and motion are relative to their observers, as long as the speed of light remains constant and natural laws are the same throughout the universe. </p>
     <h3> General Theory of Relativity </h3>
      <p class="contribution"> Einstein proposed that gravity is a curved field in the space-time continuum created by the existence of mass. Gravity defines macroscopic behaviour, and so general relativity describes large-scale physical phenomena. </p>
